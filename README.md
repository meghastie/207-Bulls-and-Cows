# CS207_Assignment_Bulls_and_Cows

Created by Megan Hastie, Scott McBride, Noa Burt, Samuel Brown and Gerard Burns for our Second Year Advanced Programming module. 

This game starts by using the terminal to allow a user to create an account, log in, continue as a Guest or quit and uses input validation to ensure a valid username is entered. The user can then play the game, view their stats, view a leaderboard (top 10 successfully deciphered codes), get instructions or quit. On choosing to play the game, the user will be tasked with deciphering a secret code, consisting of either 4 different numbers or letters. Each guess the user makes, they will be shown how many 'Bulls' and 'Cows' they managed to achieve. A Cow represents a correct character, but is in the wrong position and a Bull represents a correct character, at the correct location - if the user gets 4 Bulls they win. The user is also able to save/load a secret code so they can try deciphering it again. They can also get a hint to help solve their code. 

The project scored 112 out of 129 possible marks.
